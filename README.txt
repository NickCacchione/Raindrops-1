This game is played by moving a catcher across the screen in an attempt to catch falling raindrops. 
As a raindrop is caught, the score increases. Notice that each time the score is a number divisible by ten, the text size increases.
If a raindrop is not caught, the score does not increase, but rather the lives decrease.
In addition, if a raindrop is not caught the image used for the catcher changes.

**Algorithm for Raindrop Game**

-Create a variable to keep track of the score and lives.
-Create an array of raindrops from a Raindrop Class.
-Create a cather from a Catcher Class.
-Make the catcher move with the mouse.
-If the raindrop touches the cathcher, increase the score and remove the raindrop from the screen.
-If the raindrop does not touch the catcer do not increase the score and decreasae the lives.

One glitch in the game is that the inital raindrop that falls is closely followed by another.
All other raindrops fall with the correct timing.
